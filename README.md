**NaughTTY** is a CLI tool and Python package for running commands in a pseudo-terminal.

Full documentation is published at [naughtty.readthedocs.io](https://naughtty.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

**NaughTTY** requires **Python 3.8 or later** and a **compatible operating system**.

```bash
pip install naughtty
```

**NaughTTY** requires the host operating system to support forking and pseudo-terminals. GNU/Linux is good. At the time of writing, Windows is not. No guarantees are made for any operating system.

## Basic CLI usage

```bash
naughtty APP > output-with-escape-codes.txt
naughtty APP | APP-THAT-USES-ESCAPE-CODES
```

For example:

```bash
naughtty pipenv --help > help.txt
naughtty pipenv --help | less
```

## Basic Python usage

from naughtty import NaughTTY

ntty = NaughTTY(["pipenv", "--help"])
ntty.execute()
print(ntty.output)
```
