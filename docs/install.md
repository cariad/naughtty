# Installation

NaughTTY requires **Python 3.8 or later** and a **compatible operating system**.

```bash
pip install naughtty
```

!!! warning
    NaughTTY requires the host operating system to support pseudo-terminals. GNU/Linux is good. At the time of writing, Windows is not. No guarantees are made for any operating system.
